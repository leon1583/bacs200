<h2>What I like to do:</h2>
<p>I love hiking, photography, flying my drone, traveling, and most importantly, experiencing God. This website will share some of the things I love.</p>
<p>
"Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent." (Jesus Christ, John 17:3). We all have a chance to know God personally and experience Him. Do you know Him?
